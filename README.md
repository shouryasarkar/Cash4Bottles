#Cash4Bottles
Title of Innovation: Cash4Bottles

Objective:

To incentivize and promote plastic bottle recycling through the installation of vending machines that reward users with cash for depositing their plastic bottles. The project aims to encourage individuals to take an active role in environmental sustainability by providing a convenient and financially rewarding way to recycle plastic bottles. By increasing the amount of plastic bottles that are recycled, the project also seeks to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills, oceans, and other natural environments, thereby contributing to a cleaner, healthier planet. Additionally, the project aims to generate awareness and education about the importance of responsible waste management practices, particularly with regards to plastic waste, and to encourage positive environmental behaviour change among individuals and communities.
